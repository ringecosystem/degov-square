# DeGov Square

DeGov Square is a hub for DAOs that use the [degov](https://github.com/ringecosystem/degov) toolkit for governance. The setup files for these DAOs are available in the [degov-registry](https://github.com/ringecosystem/degov-registry).

If your DAO uses DeGov for governance, feel free to submit a pull request to add it to the registry.
